# Coding Conventions
- All components go under src/components
- Each component has its own folder to accomodate unit tests
- Components are named using dash case (e.g. slideshow-admin.tsx)
- MUI is used for base elements with sx prop for styles 
- Styles are declared below component function using stylesWithLabels (never inline)
